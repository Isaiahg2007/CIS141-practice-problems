#1. Given a list of numbers, write code to iterate through the list and calculate the sum of all even numbers. Print the resulting sum.

l=input("Please provide a list of positive numbers: ").split()
print(l)
a=0
for i in l:
    if int(i)%2==0:
        a=a+int(i)
print(a)

#2. With a list of strings provided, write code that counts how many times the word "Olympic" appears in the list, and then print the count.

l1=input("Please provide a sentence: ").split()
b=0
for word in l1:
    if word=="Olympic":
        b+=1
print(b)

#3. Given a list of strings, write code to create a new list that includes only the strings longer than three characters. Print the resulting filtered list.

l2=input("Please provide a sentence: ").split()
c=0
for word2 in l2:
    if len(word2)<=3:
        l2.pop(c)
    c+=1
print(l2)

#4. For a list of integers, write code that counts how many numbers are positive and how many are negative, then print both counts.

l3=input("Please provide a list of numbers: ").split()
print(l3)
a1=0
b1=0
for num in l3:
    if int(num)>0:
        a1+=1
    if int(num)<0:
        b1+=1
print("Positive numbers are: ", a1)
print("Negative numbers are: ", b1)

#5. For a list of integers, use a loop to build a new list where each element is the square of the corresponding element in the original list. Print the new list.
l4=input("Please provide a list of numbers: ").split()
a2=[]
for i in l4:
    q=int(i)*int(i)
    a2.append(q)
print("Squared numbers:", a2)
