#1. Construct a truth table for the expression: (A AND B) OR (NOT B) where A and B each can be True or False. Your truth table should be commented out (as it's not valid Python code!)

#2. The headlights of a car should only automatically turn on when the daylight outside is below a certain threshold. If a sensor threshold is below the number 8, print 
#"Headlights On"; otherwise, print "Headlights Off".

#3. Prompt the user for their bank balance. Evaluate whether the balance is less than $100. Print True if the userâ€™s balance is below $100; print False, otherwise.

#4. A theater wants to enforce age restrictions for movie tickets. Ask the user for their age, and tell them whether they can see G (appropriate for under 13), PG-13 
#(appropriate for 13 to 17), or R (appropriate for over 18) rated movies.

#5. A store charges $5 for shipping on any order under $50. If the order amount is $50 or more, shipping is free. Ask the user for the order total and print the total cost, 
#including shipping.

#A          B           (A AND B)       (NOT B)
# False     False       False   True    True
# False     True        False   False   False
# True      False       False   True    True
# True      True        True    False   True
