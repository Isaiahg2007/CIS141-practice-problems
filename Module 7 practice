#1. Write a function called count_vowels(input) that takes a string
#    and returns the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in it.

def count_vowels(input_string):
    count = 0
    for i in input_string:
        if i=="a":

#2. Write a function called is_palindrome(s) that checks whether a string is a palindrome
#    (reads the same forward and backward, ignoring case). The function should returns
#    either True or False.

#3. In the game Pokemon, certain types of Pokemon do extra damage to other types.
#    For example, water is very effective to fight fire.
#    Write a function called type_advantage(attacker, defender) that takes two Pokémon types as
#    strings and returns "Super Effective", "Not Very Effective", or "Neutral" based on
#    simple type effectiveness rules. Your solution only needs to work for these three sets of input:
#    print(type_advantage("Water", "Fire"))  # "Super Effective"
#    print(type_advantage("Fire", "Water"))  # "Not Very Effective"
#    print(type_advantage("Electric", "Grass"))  # "Neutral"

            return "Very effective"
    if attacker=="electric":
        if defender=="grass":
            return "Neutral"
    else:

        defender=input("What is the defender? ")
        print(type_advantage(attacker,defender))

print(type_advantage(lower_attacker,lower_defender))

#4. Write a function called ferry_fare(age, vehicle) that calculates the Washington State Ferry fare
#    based on age and whether the person has a vehicle. Assume the following rates:
#    * Adults (19-64): $10 without a vehicle, $20 with a vehicle.
#    * Seniors (65+): $5 without a vehicle, $15 with a vehicle.
#    * Children (0-18): Free.

age=(int(input("Hello! How old are you?: ")))

#Seniors=("Seniors 65+")
#Adults=("Adults 19-64")

        if vehicle=="Yes": 
            return("Alright, that will be 20 dollars. Enjoy your trip aboard the Washington State ferries!")
print(ferry_fare(age,vehicle))


#5. Write a function called level_up(experience) that takes a player's experience points
#    and returns their new level based on these rules:
#    * 0-99 XP → Level 1
#    * 100-199 XP → Level 2
#    * 200+ XP → Level 3
experience=int(input("What is you xp amount?: "))

def level_up(experience):
    if experience<=99:
        return("You are level 1!")
    if experience>=200: 
        return("You are level 3!")
    else:
        experience==range(100,199)
        return("You are level two!")
print(level_up(experience))
