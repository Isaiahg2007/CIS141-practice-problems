#1. Prompt the user for a positive integer n. Use a while loop to sum all the integers from 1 up to n. Print the final sum.

n1=int(input("Hello, what is your number? "))
n2=1
sum=0

while n2<=n1:
    print("Num= ", n2, "Sum= ", sum)
    sum+=n2
    n2+=1
print("Sum is ", sum)
print("\n")

#2. Define a string variable (e.g., my_string = "Olympic College"). Use a for loop to print each character on its own line. Convert each character to uppercase before printing.
str1="Yippee"
for str2 in str1:
    print(str2.upper())
    print(" ")

#3. Use a for loop and the range() function to print all even numbers from 2 to 20.
for n in range(2,22,2):
    print(n)

#4. Use nested for loops to create a simple multiplication table for numbers 1 through 5. Format your output so that each row corresponds to multiplying by a specific number. 
#Example output:

# 1   2   3   4   5
# 2   4   6   8   10
# 3   6   9   12  15
# 4   8   12  16  20
# 5   10  15  20  25

for i in range(1,6):
    for n in range(1,6):
        print(f"{i * n:4}", end="")
    print("\n") 

#5. Write a program that continuously asks the user to input a number. If the user enters 0, immediately stop asking for more numbers. Otherwise, print the number they entered. Sample interaction:

#Enter a number (0 to stop): 4
#You entered 4
#Enter a number (0 to stop): 7
#You entered 7
#Enter a number (0 to stop): 0
#Exiting...

n=int(input("Enter a number: "))
while n>0:
    print("You entered (0 to stop) ", n)
    n=int(input("Enter a number: "))
print("You have exited")
